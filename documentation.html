<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>PyCalc is your graphing calculator solution for a number of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the classroom</strong>, where the the calculator can be projected on the screen, with graphing both functions and their derivatives.</li>
<li><strong>the office</strong>, where the desktop designed, beautiful, and easy-to-used user interface makes the dreary bore of the cubicle farm a little more bright</li>
<li><strong>at home</strong>, where even little Johnny can easily use the four functions of the calculator, while doing bills, you can use the scientific functions</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, the PyCalc team developed a graphing calculator with a simple, easy-to-use GUI with both mouse and keyboard functionality. It utilizes functions not included in the TI-83, TI-84, HP-50 series of mainstream graphing calculators, such as the derivative and definite integral functions. Its highlighted sections of functions(displayed below) makes it easy for a kindergartener to know what buttons to push, while a college students can use it to do more advanced functions.</p>
</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>Several members of our group are in high-level mathematics classes like AP Calculus. We saw that teachers were still using old-age technology, such as an overhead projector and TI-84 graphing calculator display. The PyCalc device is well positioned to ride the wave of technology-in-the-classroom to computers and projectors in schools across the nation. It is both powerful enough for complex mathematical applications, and simple enough for children to use.</p>
<p>When beginning to code our application, we first looked at a number of GUI modules for python. Tkinter proved to be the optimal solution. Not only is it the "official" GUI of Python, it is cross-platform and easy-to-use for code beginners, while being extensible enough for experienced users.</p>
<p>As a group, we often used <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow.com</a> to solve any debugging or code concept issues. When, for example, issues arose with the "onclick" command of certain buttons were activated when the python script was executed. After looking at StackOverflow.com, we found that the runtime errors that had occurred were easily corrected with one line of code.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem &amp; Solution</h2>
<h3>The Problem: There is no universal calculator which can be used by anyone from grade 1 to college.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;">The Solution:</span><h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<p>We broke the work up into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphical user interface(GUI) design</li>
<ul>
<li>We designed the user interface using Photoshop</li>
<li>Then, we transferred the file into a Tkinter Python interface</li>
</ul>
<li>the Backend and Data Structure Design</li>
<ul>
<li>We developed the math functions separately from the GUI</li>
<li>The replace_english() subroutine, for example, takes an input expresssion to be converted to a python-evaluatable expression</li>
<li>This work required an intimate knowledge of algorithms and mathematics</li>
</ul>
<li>Infrastructure between GUI and backend</li>
<ul>
<li>The most error-prone of all of the tasks, this required expert knowledge of Tkinter and mathematics</li>
<li>Button handlers, as well as scrolling functions were designed in this stage.</li>
</ul>
<li>Documentation and assorted paperwork</li>
<ul>
<li>One team member was the go-to for software documentation.</li>
<li>Our programmers collaborated closely with him to elaborate the concepts used in our calculator.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
