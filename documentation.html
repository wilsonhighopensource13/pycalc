<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>PyCalc is your graphing calculator solution for a number of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the classroom</strong>, where the the calculator can be projected on the screen, with graphing both functions and their derivatives.</li>
<li><strong>the office</strong>, where the desktop designed, beautiful, and easy-to-used user interface makes the dreary bore of the cubicle farm a little more bright</li>
<li><strong>at home</strong>, where even little Johnny can easily use the four functions of the calculator, while doing bills, you can use the scientific functions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>Several members of our group are in high-level mathematics classes like AP Calculus. We saw that teachers were still using old-age technology, such as an overhead projector and TI-84 graphing calculator display case. The PyCalc device hopes to ride the wave of technology-in-the-classroom to computers and projectors in schools across the nation. It hopes to be both extensible enough for complex mathematical applications, and simple enough for children to use.</p>
<p>When beginning to code our application, we first looked at a number of GUI modules for python. Tkinter proved to be the optimal solution. Not only is it the "official" GUI of Python, it is cross-platform and easy-to-use for code beginners, while being extensible enough for experienced users.</p>
<p>As a group, we often used <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow.com</a> to solve any debugging or code concept issues. When, for example, issues arose with the "onclick" command of certain buttons were activated when the python script was executed. After looking at StackOverflow.com, we found that the runtime errors that had occurred were easily corrected with one line of code.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem &amp; Solution</h2>
<h3>The Problem: To help everyone from elementary students to calculus students to do mathematics in a simple way.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;">The Solution:</span>Develop a graphing calculator with a simple, easy-to-use GUI with both mouse and keyboard functionality.</p>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/wilsonhighopensource13/pycalc/master/img/scrn.png">
<p>Utilize functions not included in the TI-83, TI-84, HP-50 series of mainstream graphing calculators, such as the derivative application.</p>
<h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<p>We broke the work up into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphical user interface(GUI) design</li>
<ul>
<li>Using Tkinter</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
