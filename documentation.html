<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>PyCalc is your graphing calculator solution for a number of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the classroom</strong>, where the the calculator can be projected on the screen, with graphing both functions and their derivatives.</li>
<li><strong>the office</strong>, where the desktop designed, beautiful, and easy-to-used user interface makes the dreary bore of the cubicle farm a little more bright</li>
<li><strong>at home</strong>, where even little Johnny can easily use the four functions of the calculator; when balancing budgets, you can do the same.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this in mind, the PyCalc team developed a graphing calculator with a simple, easy-to-use GUI with both mouse and keyboard functionality. It utilizes functions not included in the TI-83, TI-84, or HP-50 series of mainstream graphing calculators, such as the derivative and definite integral functions. Its highlighted sections of functions make it easy for a kindergartener to know what buttons to push, while a college students can use it to do more advanced functions.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>Several members of our group are in high-level mathematics classes like AP Calculus. We saw that teachers were still using old-age technology, such as an overhead projector and TI-84 graphing calculator display. The PyCalc device is well positioned to ride the wave of technology-in-the-classroom to computers and projectors in schools across the nation. It is both powerful enough for complex mathematical applications, and simple enough for children to use.</p>
<p>When beginning to code our application, we first looked at a number of GUI modules for python. Tkinter proved to be the optimal solution. Not only is it the "official" GUI of Python, it is cross-platform and easy-to-use for code beginners, while being extensible enough for experienced users.</p>
<p>As a group, we often used <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow.com</a> to solve any debugging or code concept issues. When, for example, issues arose with the "onclick" command of certain buttons were activated when the python script was executed. After looking at StackOverflow.com, we found that the runtime errors that had occurred were easily corrected with one line of code.</p>

<p>Tutorials, such as the matplotlib website, served an important role in guiding our code to the finish. Effbot's tkinter tutorial was particularly effective. It provided succinct documentation as well as elaboration on making code more maintainable and readable. Matplotlib's website also provided very much help. Its tutorial displayed dozens of useful examples, which showed by example how to implement our graphing capabilities.</p>
<p>As we continued development, we asked our teachers to request further features in the PyCalc. They asked for a BASIC interpreter as well as improved calculus functions, like finding the integral and derivative of a function.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem &amp; Solution</h2>
<h3>The Problem: There is no universal calculator which can be used by anyone in high school and the workplace.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;">The Solution:</span><h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<p>We broke the work up into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphical user interface(GUI) design</li>
<ul>
<li>We designed the user interface using Photoshop(see below)</li>
<li>Then, we built the UI using the Tkinter module</li>
<li>Using its grid method, we were able to give the buttons and other interface elements their clean look</li>
</ul>
<li>Backend and Data Structure Design</li>
<ul>
<li>We developed the math functions separately from the GUI</li>
<li>The replace_english subroutine, for example, takes an input expresssion to be converted to a python-evaluatable expression</li>
<li>The dint (definite integral) subroutine uses trapezoidal approximation to measure the area under a curve</li>
<li>The gderiv function calls the table_deriv_points subroutine which calls nderiv which approximates 1000s of derivative points. It then graphs these points.</li>
<li>This work required an intimate knowledge of algorithms and mathematics</li>
</ul>
<li>Infrastructure between GUI and backend</li>
<ul>
<li>The most error-prone of all of the tasks, this required expert knowledge of Tkinter and mathematics</li>
<li>Button handlers, as well as scrolling functions were designed in this stage.</li>
<li>Thanks to the use of encapsulation during the backend construction,</li>
</ul>
<li>Documentation and assorted paperwork</li>
<ul>
<li>One team member was the go-to for software documentation.</li>
<li>Our programmers collaborated closely with him to elaborate the concepts used in our calculator.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
