<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>PyCalc is your graphing calculator solution for a number of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the classroom</strong>, where the the calculator can be projected on the screen, with graphing both functions and their derivatives.</li>
<li><strong>the office</strong>, where the desktop designed, beautiful, and easy-to-used user interface makes the dreary bore of the cubicle farm a little more bright</li>
<li><strong>at home</strong>, where even little Johnny can easily use the four functions of the calculator; when balancing budgets, you can do the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, the PyCalc team developed a graphing calculator with a simple, easy-to-use GUI with both mouse and keyboard functionality. It utilizes functions not included in the TI-83, TI-84, HP-50 series of mainstream graphing calculators, such as the derivative and definite integral functions. Its highlighted sections of functions(displayed below) makes it easy for a kindergartener to know what buttons to push, while a college students can use it to do more advanced functions.</p>
